# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Afterwards, a multiple-line graph is requested to show the weekly fares for each city type to show a visual comparison between the city types over a four-month period.

## Results
[Based on the summary dataframe,](./analysis/PyBer_fare_summary_dataframe.png) within the four-month period, urban cities collectively have more rides, drivers, and total fares than suburban and rural cities. Suburban cities also have more rides, drivers, and total fares compared to rural cities. However, the average fare per ride and per driver are going in the oppositie direction. In other words, rural cities have higher fees, while urban cities have lower fees, with suburban cities being between both city types. [Looking at the total fares on a weekly basis during the four-month period,](./analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png) urban cities collectively have more weekly fares, followed by suburban cities, and finally rural cities.

## Summary

One recommendation would be abolishing rides for rural cities. From the summary dataframe, there have been 125 rides total within the four-month period. That equates to a little over one ride per day. It wouldn't make sense to keep support for rural regions if it didn't get much traction revenue-wise. Another recommendation would be lowering fees for rural and suburban cities. This would help attempt more people to request rides within those city types.
